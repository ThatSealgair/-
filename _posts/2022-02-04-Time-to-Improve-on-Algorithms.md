I was completely clapped today at the UQ Computing Society CodeJam 2022. I came 69th out of 79 people. From this, and some experience with [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com) I have realised my understanding of algorithms and their implementation is lacking. Prior to this, I was looking at completing some algorithms content either through an online course or a textbook. I have decided to use a bit of both.

The course chosen is this from [FreeCodeCamp](https://youtu.be/pkYVOmU3MgA). It appears to be good from a surface level. I had also purchased a course on Udemy previously and made little progress past linked-lists but I found the explanations from the instructor to be insufficient. I may go back over that following the completion of this course.

Since the last post, I have made great headway in understanding reverse engineering and how assembly-level instructions work. As the courses I am enrolled in focus on this area, I will continue to focus on that, but I have starting reading *Combinatorics and Graph Theory* by John M. Harris, Jeffry L. Hirst, and Michael J. Mossinghoff. Though not directly related to algorithms, I would assume many concepts would cross-over between the domains.

Onto books focused on algorithms, I will peruse the following over the next year in no particular order:
- *Algorithms in a Nutshell* by George T. Heineman
- *Algorithmic Thinking* by Daniel Zingaro
- *Mastering Algorithms with C*  by Kyle Loudon
- *Introduction to Algorithms* by Thomas H Cormen 

The final book on this list is required for a future course I am required to take. 

Next year, I hope to be in the top 15 at least. To achieve this, I will go through the content of the learning material mentioned. On top of this, I will begin to use [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com),  [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), and [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) on a daily basis if possible. I am also going to try to solve this questions using C, Rust, or Haskell as the language rather than Python. This is so I can practice at languages I will be using more often later on and force myself to try new approaches to problems.
