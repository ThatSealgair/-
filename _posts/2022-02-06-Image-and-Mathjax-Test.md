# Don't you do math?
I would like to post the occassional equation that is formatted by *mathjax*. I was reading [this writeup](https://s3v3ru5.github.io/notes/DiceCTF2021) by [s3v3ru5](https://twitter.com/S3v3ru5_) and saw that they got it to work. 

Here is a test, $$log_{b}x=y\quad\iff\quad b^{y}=x$$
